The files in this repo contain the code for completing the 1st course project for Exploratory Data Analysis on Coursera.

Each r script (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) contains all of the necessary code to generate the required graphs.
The graphs can be found in the repo (plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png)

Each R script pulls the necessary data from a local machine. The path, found at the top of each script, to the directory must be changed if you want to run this on your own.

The data for running the code can be found in the README.md file.
